#### Example:
* **Create a title:** Advent of DNA Profiling
* **Create a Description:** The concept of genetic fingerprinting, also commonly known as DNA Profiling, 
was first created in 1984 by Sir Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester in England. It has taken four years for the 
technique, which allows any trace elements (like human hair, skin, or blood) to be traced for DNA, to reach the United States 
en masse, but it is now being used for widespread criminal investigations, and the surface is just being scratched on its 
potential uses.
