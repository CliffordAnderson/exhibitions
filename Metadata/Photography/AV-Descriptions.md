Text is not yet finalized and is subject to further editing._

#### Clip 1 | Getty Museum: Photographers of Genius
* Description: The J. Paul Getty Museum’s collection of still photography represents the history of photography beginning 
in 1842, when photographers could reliably control the medium, and documents the stylistic evolution from portraiture to 
nature to landscapes and environment. The collection profiles photographers from artist to documentarian who applied their 
skill and talent to create social change, record real life experience and study the environment and society.

#### Clip 2 | Unknown Photographer Vivian Maier
* Description: The remarkable pictures of photographer, Vivian Maier, who worked as a nanny and housekeeper in Chicago, were kept secret until she died in 2009 at age 83. Looking for pictures of the city for a book he was writing, real estate agent John Maloof bid on the negatives that were auctioned to cover delinquent payments on a storage locker following her death. He never expected the treasure he found among the more than 100,000 photographs Maier took of herself and street life in Chicago on her own time using a Roloflex camera and an amazing amount of talent. 

#### Clip 3 | Year of the Selfie
* Description: Selfie, Oxford Dictionaries’ 2013 Word of the Year, is defined as “a photographic self-portrait; esp. one 
taken with a smartphone or webcam and shared via social media”. On Twitter alone, the word selfie was mentioned 92 million 
times. The advent of the front facing camera phone in 2010 put the power and creativity of self-snaps directly in our hands
– and it’s not enough to just take photos, posting them on social media sites has become part of our digital identity. It’s 
who we are, where we are and who we’re with… a moment in time we can’t wait to share. 

#### Clip 4 | Modern Tintype Photos of War
* Description: Men who died during the Civil War are brought to life through collections of tintypes taken by photographers with primitive 
cameras and horse drawn darkrooms. Tintype was not used on the battlefield again until Ed Drew, guardsman and student 
photographer, brought an antique camera on tour in Afghanistan, asking his combat unit to bare their soul to the camera. 
Modern tintype poses the same challenge with chemicals, time to set up, pose and have the subject remain still –  a process 
often interrupted by a call to combat, and like those from battles past portrays soldiers as men and individuals.

#### Clip 5 | The Big Picture
* Description: The remarkably detailed giant photos taken by artist Clifford Ross attracted interest from the art world, NASA and the 
National Security Agency. Not just size, but detail that gets sharper as you zoom in makes these images special. Negatives 
are 2.6 gigabyte files – 100x more data than advanced digital cameras. The R1 camera system Ross  invented uses military 
aerial film and a post-production process capable of capturing amazing detail two miles away. The government is interested 
in Ross’ technology and technique for seeing patterns in images, detecting things that are out of place by stepping back to 
look at detail of the big picture.

#### Clip 6 | Portraits of Poverty
* Description: Following the tradition of photographers who captured the humanity of those affected by extreme poverty of the 
great depression to tell the story in a compelling way through images, photographer Steve Liss is taking pictures of modern-
day Americans living in poverty. His project, In Our Own Backyard, documents a family in Athens County, Ohio and their 
struggle with poverty in society. Like the depression-era photographers, Liss uses the power of images to make the invisible 
visible.

#### Clip 7 | Road to Freedom Photo Exhibit
* Description: The Road to Freedom exhibit of photographs highlighting the civil rights era: photos of the protest & the 
photographers shown. Photographer Bob Adelman recalls the movement, his best photo, having to carry a gun & his role as a 
photographer of the movement. "The Race Beat" author Gene Roberts says the newspaper photos had an impact; recounts what Dr. 
Martin Luther King said to a black photographer. [A look back at the work of photographers who covered the civil rights 
movements, often finding it difficult to be a passive observer as they were met with violence just as were those they were 
documenting. The wire service camera men made the difference /were vital…supplying day by day news coverage with powerful 
images of injustice on the front pages of newspapers across America.] 

#### Clip 8 | Eastman Kodak Goes Bankrupt
* Description: For more than a century Kodak cameras and film helped us capture our most cherished moments. They defined the 
camera business in the 20th century by selling millions of Brownie cameras, the instamatic in the 1960’s and video cameras 
in the 1970s. Despite having invented the digital camera in 1975, they lost the technology race.  The end of bankrupt Eastman 
Kodak’s production of cameras reported. [Kodak instamatic camera for less than $10; load with a cartridge and use flash cubes 
and take beautiful color snapshots and color slides; at less than $10 to purchase making them affordable to many consumers; 
Kodak brand with the tagline “Kodak Moment” heavy advertising portraying a range of holidays and special occasions as the 
perfect opportunity to capture the moment.] 

#### Clip 9 | Photography Ban on NYC Subway
* Description: New York City's consideration of a ban on photography on the subway system to prevent terrorism examined; 
[Photographers Camillo VERGARA†, Bruce DAVIDSON†- say the subway was their studio; oppose a law against photography; 
cite the sense of community.] [Former anti-terrorism officer Jack CLOONAN - cites the number of subway photographs on 
Websites.] ban photography to prevent terrorist attack, but threatens right  to photograph subway symbol of life…  since 
1930s photo has used it to capture humanity; some would argue not allow phot to explores the culture; enforcing law is 
running scared … suspension erodes community, friendship, citizenship.]

#### Clip 10 | Shooting Big Cats for _National Geographic_
* Description: _National Geographic_ photographer Steve Winter became famous for his photos of snow leopards in the Himalaya’s 
– the first intimate portrait of cats – and has spent most of his adult life shooting every type of cat on the planet. 
Winter’s innovative techniques allow him to capture portraits of the world’s most elusive cats. He sets up the lighting for a 
stage and waits for the actor to walk on, hoping to capture something that will wow the viewer to become part of their world...
such as the picture of a cougar under the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park.  

#### Clip 11 | Kodak Moments
* Description: The Eastman Kodak Company is best known by its Kodak brand of cameras and photographic film products. Kodak 
began to struggle financially in the late 1990s as a result of the decline in sales of photographic film and its slowness in 
transitioning to digital photography, despite having invented the core technology used in current digital cameras.  The 
company's ubiquity was such that its tagline "Kodak moment" entered the common lexicon to describe a personal event that 
demanded to be recorded for posterity. Their products were designed for ease of use and affordably priced.
