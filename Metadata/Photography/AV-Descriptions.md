#### Clip 1 | Getty Museum: Photographers of Genius
* Description: The J. Paul Getty Museum’s collection of still photography represents the history of photography beginning in 1842, when photographers could reliably control the medium and documents the stylistic evolution from portraiture to nature to landscapes and the environment. The collection profiles photographers from artist to documentarian who applied their skill and talent to create social change, record real life experience and study the environment and society.

#### Clip 2 | Unknown Photographer Vivian Maier
* Description: The remarkable photographs taken by Vivian Maier, a Chicago nanny and housekeeper, were kept secret until she died in 2009 at age 83. Looking for pictures of the city for a book he was writing, real estate agent John Maloof bid on the negatives in Maier’s storage locker that were auctioned to cover delinquent payments following her death. He never expected the treasure he found among the more than 100,000 photographs Maier took on her own time of herself and street life in Chicago using a Roloflex camera and amazing talent.  

#### Clip 3 | Year of the Selfie
* Description: Selfie, Oxford Dictionaries’ 2013 Word of the Year, is defined as “a photographic self-portrait; esp. one taken with a smartphone or webcam and shared via social media.” On Twitter alone, the word selfie was mentioned 92 million times. The advent of the front facing camera phone in 2010 put the power and creativity of self-snaps directly in our hands – but it’s not enough to just take photos, posting them on social media sites has become part of our digital identity. It’s who we are, where we are and who we’re with… a moment in time to be shared. 

#### Clip 4 | Modern Tintype Photos of War
* Description: Men who died during the Civil War are brought to life through collections of tintypes taken by photographers with primitive cameras and horse drawn darkrooms. Tintype was not used on the battlefield again until Ed Drew, guardsman and student photographer, brought an antique camera on tour in Afghanistan, asking his combat unit to bare their soul to the camera to portray soldiers as men and individuals. Modern tintype poses the same challenge with chemicals, time to set up, pose and have the subject remain still – a long process often interrupted by a call to combat.

#### Clip 5 | The Big Picture
* Description: The remarkably detailed giant photos taken by artist Clifford Ross attracted interest from art, science and national security. Size and detail that gets sharper as you zoom in makes these images special. The R1 camera system Ross invented uses military aerial film and a post-production process capable of capturing amazing detail two miles away. The government is interested in the technology and Ross’ technique for seeing patterns in images and detecting things that are out of place by observing  detail of the big picture.

#### Clip 6 | Portraits of Poverty
* Description: Following the tradition of photographers of the Great Depression who captured the humanity of those affected by extreme poverty to tell the story in a compelling way through images, photographer Steve Liss is taking pictures of modern-day Americans living in poverty. His project, In Our Own Backyard, documents a family in Athens County, Ohio, and their struggle with poverty in society. Like the depression-era photographers, Liss uses the power of images to make the invisible visible.

#### Clip 7 | Road to Freedom Photo Exhibit
* Description: The Road to Freedom exhibit looks back at the work and the role of photographers who covered the Civil Rights Movement. These journalists were vital to the cause by supplying day by day news coverage with powerful images of injustice on the front pages of newspapers across America. They made the difference, often finding it difficult to be passive observers as they were met with violence just as were those they were documenting. 

#### Clip 8 | Eastman Kodak Goes Bankrupt
* Description: For more than a century, Kodak products helped us capture our most cherished moments. They defined the camera business in the 20th century by selling millions of Brownie cameras, the instamatic in the 1960’s and video cameras in the 1970s. Despite having invented the digital camera in 1975, they lost the technology race. Bankrupt, Eastman Kodak announced the end of their production of cameras. 

#### Clip 9 | Photography Ban on NYC Subway
* Description: New York City's consideration to ban photography on the subway system to prevent terrorist attacks met with opposition by those who say the subway is their studio. Some argue that suspending the right to take photographs in the subway is running scared and erodes community, friendship and citizenship. The NYC subway has served as a symbol of life since the 1930s and countless photographers have used it to explore the culture and capture humanity.

#### Clip 10 | Shooting Big Cats for _National Geographic_
* Description: _National Geographic_ photographer Steve Winter, famous for his photos of snow leopards in the Himalaya’s, spent most of his adult life shooting every type of cat on earth. Winter’s innovative techniques allow him to capture intimate portraits of the world’s most elusive cats. He sets the lighting and waits for the actor to walk on stage, hoping to capture something that will wow the viewer – such as the picture of a cougar under the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles’ Griffith Park.    

#### Clip 11 | Kodak Moments
* Description: The Eastman Kodak Company was best known by its photographic film products and cameras designed for ease of use and priced affordably. Despite having invented the core technology used in current digital cameras, Kodak began to struggle financially in the late 1990s due to declining film sales and its slowness in transitioning to digital photography. The company's ubiquity was such that its tagline "Kodak moment" entered the common lexicon to describe a personal event that demanded to be recorded for posterity.
