* Image Title | [Katherine Anderson in the laboratory]
  * Filename: Eskind_VUMC-K_Anderson-Scrapbook-A.jpg
  * Katherine Anderson (1909-1995) received a PhD in bacteriology from Vanderbilt in 1940. Her interest in viruses led to her work in Dr. Goodpasture's lab. The couple married in 1945, after which she worked on environmental issues, natural habitats and ornithology.
* Image Title | [Nurses with the Vanderbilt Hospital in France]
  * Filename: Eskind_VUMC-WW1-Nurses-1918.jpg
  * In Nashville, Confederate veterans raised $887 selling newspapers and sent small Christmas gifts of 84 French francs to 31 privates and 16 nurses in 1918.  The Vanderbilt Unit, like others from major American hospitals, included doctors and local nurses, many from Davidson County. Head Nurse Catherine Sinnot worked for St. Thomas Hospital and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for her "splendid leadership, tireless energy, and unselfish devotion."  Few nurses were identified in the photos.
* Image Title | [HeLa Cancer Cell]
  * Filename: Eskind_VUMC-Cancer-Cell-1956-42.jpg
  * Dr. Ernest Goodpasture was Chair of Pathology at Vanderbilt University from 1924-1955 and remains known for his work developing vaccines 
  by culturing them in chicken eggs. Goodpasture used so-called immortal HeLa cells as many pathologists did after they became availble in 1951.The line was derived from cervical cancer cells (circled in red) taken on February 8, 1951 from cancer patient Henrietta Lacks.
* Image Title | [Dr. Ernest W. Goodpasture in his lab]
  * Filename: Eskind_VUMC-E_Goodpasture-Scrapbook.jpg
  * Goodpasture studied medicine at Johns Hopkins University, earning his M.D. in 1912. He became interested in vaccines working at Chelsea Naval Hospital’s pathology lab during the 1918 influenza epidemic. In 1925, Goodpasture arrived at Vanderbilt as part of the move to modernize medical education in the South. He discovered how to culture vaccines in fertile hen’s eggs.  This discovery made possible effective, cheap vaccines for influenza, small pox and other diseases.
* Image Title | [Lt. Kennon's Moustache and Lesser Objects]
  * Filename: Eskind_VUMC-Lt.Kennon-1917.jpg
  * Dr. William G. Kennon specialized in surgery of the eye, ear, nose and throat. Vanderbilt and other medical schools recruited doctors and nurses to assist the American Expeditionary Force in France after the U.S. joined the war in 1917. One of 12 doctors from Vanderbilt, Kennon worked with Nashville-area nurses and enlisted men at Vanderbilt Hospital Units in Nevers, central France. In contrast to the formal portraits, this image shows the photographer’s sense of humor.
* Image Title | [William Gunter, Jr. autopsy technician and photographer]
  * Filename: Eskind_VUMC-W_Gunter-scrapbook.jpg
  * Gunter was an autopsy technician in the Department of Pathology, as well as a skilled photographer praised by Goodpasture for his work for Pathology and other departments.  Bill’s brother Albert and his father Bill Sr., both worked in Pathology as assistants or deaners.

#### That Kodak Moment: Memory-Making (II)
* Image Title | [Notre Dame de Paris]
  * Filename: MS0483-P-Paris-Notre_Dame.jpg
  * Architectural portraits of medieval buildings often popularize restorations. When Victor Hugo made the Cathedral famous in his novel, Notre-Dame de Paris (1831), he described a building that had been badly damaged during the French Revolution.  It was restored in the mid-nineteenth-century by architects Eugène Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc and Jean-Baptiste Lassus. The Gallery of Kings above the portals was battered by Revolutionaries but re-installed in pristine form during the restoration.
* Image Title | [Ft. Marion-St. Augustine &amp; Harbor, FL]
  * Filename:  MS0827-P-St_Augustine-1898.jpg
  * Completed in 1695, Fort Marion (now Castillo de San Marcos) is the oldest surviving masonry fort in the continental U.S.  Engineer Ignazio Daza followed standards for building defensive structures that would withstand cannon projectiles and maximize cannon mounts to repel attackers. The bastion was built to defend St. Augustine against British attack. The coquina shell walls did not splinter into projectiles under cannon fire and mixed with aggregate absorbed cannon balls.
* Image Title | [Mt. Fox and Mt. Dawson, Selkirk Mountains Alberta Canada]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Selkirk_Mountains-1902.jpg  
  * Crossing the Selkirk Mountain Range completed the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, connecting remote British Columbia by land to the rest of newly-unified Canada. Ten years of reconnaissance surveys on foot and horseback preceded railway construction. Building the railway presented engineers with formidable challenges, like keeping the line clear. About 40 feet of snow fell on this rail line every winter it was in use. No trains ran for months in the first winter of operation.
* Image Title | [Erie Canal at Salina St., Syracuse NY]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Erie_Canal-1900.jpg
  * Built from 1817 to 1825, the 363-mile Erie Canal connected the Great Lakes with the Hudson River, making New York the Atlantic port for midwestern crops, meat, and goods.  The reduced shipping costs spurred New York’s economic explosion in the 1830s and allowed easy internal migration. Smaller Oswego Canal connects Erie Canal with Lake Ontario and the Erie Canal cuts through downtown Syracuse and continues to Buffalo on the shores of Lake Erie.
* Image Title | [Palacio Del Gobierno General, Habana, Cuba]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Havana_Cuba-1900.jpg
  * Exotic foreign locations—Cuba, Buenos Aires, Moscow, Ceylon—formed part of the Detroit Photographic Company’s images.  Marketed as “absolutely permanent,” the company sold images across multiple formats as postcards, photochroms, and sets of lantern slides. Scenic and Architectural Views and Marine Views were sold in hand-colored and black-and-white formats, all “combin[ing] the truthfulness of a photograph with the color and richness of an oil painting.”
* Image Title | [Sea Wall at Bald Head Cliff, York, Maine]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Bald_Head_Cliff-1901.jpg
  * Regular trains, overnight steamship service, and seaside hotels lured middle-class tourists from Boston, Philadelphia and New York to spend summertime in this southern Maine coastal town as early as 1875.  Besides walking cliff paths and “rusticating,” tourists explored historic towns popularized by local Sarah Orne Jewett in her novels of Maine.
* Image Title | [Crevasse Formation in Illecillwaet Glacier, Selkirk Mountains, Alberta, Canada]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Crevasse-1902.jpg
  * The transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway and great hotels the firm built changed how people saw the mountains. Once considered a barrier to progress, the mountains were now viewed by many as a major tourist attraction. Canadian Pacific Railway’s Glacier House Hotel opened near the glacier’s terminus in 1885. From the Swiss Guides working at the hotel to the photo exhibits and books, Glacier National Park in 1886, the mountains were promoted. Scientists like William H. Sherzer studied glaciers in British Columbia. His findings, including the causes of the glacier’s rich varied colors, were published in 1904 as a Smithsonian Expedition. The glacier’s name means “big water” in the Okangan language.
* Image Title | [High Water Mark at Gettysburg, PA]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Gettysburg-1903.jpg
  * The three day battle in 1863 produced the greatest bloodshed of the Civil War. Monuments, tours, and photos were produced rapidly to commemorate the fallen. The memorial cemetery opened in 1864. John Batchelder designed this 1892 monument and wrote Gettysburg: What to See and How to See It in 1873. In 1891, Pennsylvania railroad sold tourist packages in 1891 that included Gettysburg. In 1895, Gettysburg became a National Military Park with 600 acres and 320 monuments to Federal troops.
* * Image Title | [Point Sublime, Colorado]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Point_Sublime-1901.jpg
  * After the Civil War, telegraph and railroad companies created new demands for natural resources. The four major western survey expeditions mapped geological features and mineral resources of the western territories targeting military posts and exploring Canyonlands and territories. In 1870, William Henry Jackson joined Ferdinand Hayden’s group surveying Wyoming and western territories. He eventually settled in Denver, near Point Sublime, where he worked as a landscape photographer. 
* Image Title | [Pulpit Rock, Utah]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Pulpit_Rock-1900.jpg
  * The Union Pacific Railroad tracks visible in the right half of this image connect Pulpit Rock near Echo City with Portland and San Francisco. The town provided coal and water for trains entering Echo Canyon. Echo began as a stopover on the Mormon trail, becoming a junction between the First Transcontinental Railroad and a spur line to serve silver mines near Park City. Rock formations like this are found throughout the Wasatch Mountains.
* Image Title | [Pike's Peak Avenue, Colorado]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Pikes_Peak-1898.jpg
  * In 1874, Congress debated civilian versus military control of the four western mapping surveys. Hayden’s Survey, mapping the western territories, joined the U.S. Department of the Interior.   Named for explorer Zebulon Pike, the area grew in the 1890s during the last gold rush in the continental U.S.  Katharine Lee Bates wrote the song "America the Beautiful" in 1893 after admiring the view from Pikes Peak.  At 14,115 feet, it is the highest summit of the southern Front Range of the Rockies.”
* Image Title | [Passaic Falls, Patterson, New Jersey]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Passaic_Falls-1902.jpg
  * Images of natural landmarks were also part of the North American views published by the Detroit Photo Company. When New York was the nation’s capital, Alexander Hamilton picked Patterson as a site for an industrial city in 1792 based on the Passaic Falls' 77-foot drop which held great potential for powering textile production. By the 1880s, Patterson Mills produced almost half of all silk made in the U.S.
* Image Title | [Gold of Ophir Roses Carmelita, Pasadena, California]
  * Filename: MS0827-P-Ophir_Roses-1902.jpg
  * Like postcards, photochrom prints appealed to consumers as souvenirs of landscapes, tourist attractions, and idealized locales. Carmelita Garden in Pasadena showcased plants from around the world, all seen thriving in southern California’s mild weather. Started as an agricultural town, Pasadena became famous for its Tournament of Roses Parade begun in 1890 and held every year on New Year’s Day.

  * Filename: MS0546-P-85-Coach-1901.jpg
  * James Ricalton wrote of being the first Westerner inside the Imperial City. He described the palace as “empty of nearly all portable articles” after the looting by Allied troops and missionaries. Ricalton’s wanted armchair travelers to experience "the very same feelings [in Peking]" as he had. He described two states of reality viewers would experience; the reality of the physical world and an altered state of consciousness or "soul life."
* Image Title | [YMCA Rooms for Allies, Peking, China]
  * Filename:  MS0546-P-77-YMCA-1901.jpg
  * James Ricalton photographed sites, survivors, and daily life in October 1900 in Peking after the Rebellion for Underwood &amp; Underwood. Troops posted in Peking found distractions at the Y with games, coffee, lunch, and books. The YMCA provided similar services to occupying American troops Manila during the Spanish-American War. Ricalton intended his 100 images to make the viewer feel "quite at home among the streets" of Peking.
* Image Title | [Ketteler Street Peking, China]
  * Filename:  MS0546-P-70-North-1901.jpg
  *  In June 1900, anti-Western riots in Peking and the 54-day siege of foreign embassies by Chinese militants made headlines. In this image of the foreigners' quarter, Ketteler St. has been renamed for the murdered German minister Clemens von Ketteler. Manchu captain En Hai murdered Ketteler for killing an unarmed Chinese Muslin boy. James Ricalton photographed sites, survivors, and daily life in September 1900 in Peking after the Rebellion for Underwood &amp; Underwood.
* Image Title | [Typical gateway over a Street in the Imperial City, Peking, China]
  * Filename: MS0546-P-86-Architecture-1901.jpg 
  * Stereographers often structured their images around a human in the foreground so viewers focused on a vanishing point. This allowed viewers to feel they were in the depths of the picture.
* Image Title | [Miss Smith, London Mission School, Peking, China]
  * Filename:  MS0546-P-93-Miss_Smith-1901.jpg
  * Georgina Smith ran the London Mission’s girls’ boarding school inside the embassy quarter. Her success sheltering Chinese Christian refugees there earned her fame in the West. But other pundits, among them Mark Twain, loudly criticized the wholesale looting of Chinese art and treasure after the Rebellion, singling Smith out for organizing weekly auctions of looted Qing nobles’ property. Ricalton remembered the “greatest loot-marts in the city” on the “last two miles” of Ketteler Street.
* Image Title | [American Minister Conger, Peking, China]
  * Filename: MS0546-P-97-Conger-1901.jpg
  * Ambassador Edwin H. Conger and his family, with civilians from eleven western diplomatic legations and over 2,500 Chinese Christians were besieged in the embassy district for 54 days in summer 1900. Protesting against western, Christian intrusions in their country, the Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists (Boxers) fought with the Qing Empress and an estimated 40,000 Manchu troops to remove foreigners. Conger lived, though like many, suffered long term health effects from their experiences.

  * MS0031-Barnard-Lick-Obsrv1893.jpg
  * Barnard moved to California in 1887 to inaugurate the new observatory at Mount Hamilton near San Jose.  He discovered the first non-Galilean moon of Jupiter, Amalthea, in September 1892, over 275 years after Galileo's discoveries.  Observatory staff fought over access to the 36-inch telescope, making working conditions difficult. Barnard moved to Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin in 1895 with an astronomy appointment at the University of Chicago.

* Image Title | [Jupiter Camera, Nashville, TN]
  * Filename: MS0031-Jupiter_Camera-c1885.jpg
  * Barnard worked for Van Stavoren's photo studio as a nine-year-old. He had to keep this solar camera directed on the sun to avoid setting fire to nearby buidlings. This meant spending hours awake on the roof in all weather.
* Image Title | [Total Eclipse June 8, 1918]
  * Filename: MS0031-P-Barnard-Total_Eclipse-June_8_1918.jpg
  * Barnard pioneered astrophotography as well as discovering 15 comets and the first non-Galilean moon of Jupiter. His astronomical photographs were published postyhumously as A Photographic Atlas of Selected Regions of the Milky Way (1927) completed by the director of Yerkes Observatory, and Mary R. Calvert, Barnard's niece, who worked as his assistant.
