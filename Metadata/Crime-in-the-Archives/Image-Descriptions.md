#### Making Money from Crime
* Image Title | The Lindbergh Kidnapping Case
  * Filename:
  * Sir Anthony Hopkins was a relative unknown when he took on the role of Bruno Richard Hauptmann in Columbia Pictures' 1976 "The 
Lindbergh Kidnapping Case." Hopkins won an Emmy for his performance. Sensational headlines and speculative journalism in William 
Randolph Hurst's newspapers made it difficult to find an unbiased jury. The Lindbergh kidnapping was the subject of a second film, 
1998's "The Crime of the Century," a phrase reputedly coined by newspaper reporter Damon Runyon.
* Image Title | Compulsion
  * Filename: 
  * Levin's novel was based on the 1924 Leopold and Loeb murder case. Psychiatric experts played a large part in the young men's 
  avoidance of the electric chair, as it had in the trial of Charles Guiteau, who assassinated President Garfield in 1881 and in 
  the defense of Harry Thaw in the 1906 Stanford White case. Loeb was killed in prison, but Leopold  was paroled, after which he 
  unsuccessfully sued Levin for defamation of character.
* Title | [Compulsion film poster]
  * Filename: 
  * The film "Compulsion" was based on Meyer Levin's 1956 novel of the same name. Both tell the story of the 1924 murder trial 
  of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb, two wealthy students who kidnapped and murdered 14-year old Bobby Franks. The press was on 
  the story before the killers were identified and helped to thwart the ransom delivery. How could two brilliant young men with 
  everything going for them perform such a criminal act?  What did that say about childhood in America?
* Title | Frank James and His Brother Jesse: The Daring Border Bandits
  * Filename: 
  * Western fiction got its starts in the penny dreadfuls and dime novels of the Civil War era. The "Hop Along Cassidy" stories 
  were first published in 1904 and Zane Grey's "Riders of the Purple Sage" was released in 1912. The genre peaked in 1960. "Frank 
  James and His Brother Jesse" tells the story of Jesse's murder in a sympathetic tone and follows brother Frank's efforts at 
  revenge and eventual surrender and conversion.
* Title | [Bonnie and Clyde $100,000 Novelty Bill]
  * Filename: 
  * Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow pose on this novelty $100,000 bill, replacing the image of President Woodrow Wilson that 
  adorned the few $100,000 bank notes that were actually printed by the Federal Reserve System. The couple's photographs are 
  drawn from candid shots discovered by police in April 1933. In fact, high denomination bills over $100 have not been printed 
  since 1946 and have been withdrawn from circulation by the Federal Reserve since 1969.
* Title | [Still from 'Bonnie and Clyde']
  * Filename: 
  * "Bonnie and Clyde" was a romantic and humorous interpretation of the life of Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. The 1967 film 
  broke new ground in its depiction of sex and violence and used modern filmmaking techniques inspired by French New Wave directors. 
  Historical accuracy was marginalized to evoke sympathy among viewers for the crime pair. The project was a success and was 
  influential in the use of graphic violence in the film industry.
* Title | [Time Magazine cover portrait of Jack Webb, Star of 'Dragnet']
  * Filename: 
  * Dick Wolf, producer of the television series, Law and Order, described Dragnet as “the father of us all." Jack Webb, its 
  creator and director, began the Dragnet police drama series as a radio program (1949-1955) in 1949 and continued it as a 
  television series (1952-1959 and 1967-1970). The show broke ground in its real life depiction of crime, moving away from 
  the hard-boiled dramas of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, toward a social realism with a focus on the dedicated 
  policeman.
* Title | [Digital reproduction of film still from 'The Return of Frank James']
  * Filename:
  * Western films have gone in and out of vogue since first appearing in the silent era. By the time "The Return of Frank James" 
  was released in 1940, the form was gaining new popularity with the advent of a number of high budget productions from major 
  studios. Its storyline takes up after the death of Frank's brother, Jesse James, with Frank out to avenge his brother's death.
* Title | Grolier Story of America Subscription Card: The Trial of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb (#75-13)
  * Filename:  
  * Interest in the trial of Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb has continued long after their deaths. Grolier Story of America 
  Cards  were released in sets of 20 between 1994 and 2001. Covering all aspects of American history, the cards were sold on a 
  subscription basis, with a total of 2600 cards in 130 decks or packets on topics such as "Life in America" and "Notable 
  People." The "Important Events" deck included "The Sinking of the Lusitania" and "The Boston Tea Party."
* Title | The Art of Murder
  * Filename: 
  * In the 1970s, self-published magazines, called "zines" became an important voice for alternative or marginalized media. 
  With the rise of punk culture, zines became means for communication in such areas as the queer and Riot Grrl movements. 
  John Marr's "Murder Can Be Fun" series, which ran for over 20 years, looked at strange and unusual crimes through the lens 
  of anti-establishment culture. Web browsers and the demise of independent book and record stores led to online zine 
  publication.
* Title | Please Mr. Postman Don't Shoot
  * Filename:
  * Issue number 14 of John Marr's "Murder Can Be Fun" zine tells the story of "going postal," looking at the history of 
  shootings in post offices and how the postal workers were usually the victims of the crime, rather than the perpetrators. 
  The issue also examines the history of riots in the U.S. and looks at other odd stories, including the great Nashville Train 
  Wreck of 1918.

#### Lindbergh: Crime of the Century 
* Title | [Portrait of J. Edgar Hoover]
  * Filename: 
  * Illustrator Paul Frehm worked with reporter Damon Runyon to cover the Lindbergh trial for the New York Daily Mirror, a 
  William Randoph Hurst newspaper publication. Frehm’s illustration of J. Edgar Hoover, who led the Bureau of Investigation’s 
  efforts to find the kidnapper, portrays the director in 1949. Hoover's dogged success in the case raised his own profile and 
  helped to bring the Federal Kidnapping Act to Congress, allowing federal authorities jurisdiction in cases crossing state 
  lines.
* Title | [Montage of Three Photographs of Bruno Richard Hauptmann on Trial]
  * Filename: 
  * The $50,000 ransom paid for the Lindbergh baby contained a number of gold certificates that were scheduled to be withdrawn 
  from circulation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also recorded the serial numbers of all notes. When one of the 
  certificates turned up in a Manhattan gas station, an alert attendant marked it with the license plate of a suspicious 
  customer. This led agents to arrest Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German immigrant living in the German-Austrian neighborhood 
  of Yorkville.
* Title | Breakfast in Honor of Captain Charles A. Lindbergh on the Presentation of the Raymond Orteig $25000 Dollar Prize
  * Filename: 
  * Charles Lindbergh's May 1927 solo flight from New York to Paris caught the world's attention and made him an instant 
  celebrity. Conducted on the cusp of the Great Depression and the rise of underworld crime, the flight was a shining moment 
  for a country that was quickly heading into darkness. When the pilot's baby was kidnapped in 1932, many Americans questioned 
  how something so heinous could happy to their hero. Surely, if it could happen to Lindy, it could also happen to them.
* Title | The Charles Lindbergh Flight (26th Commemorative)
  * Filename: MS0412-Lindbergh-coin.xml
  * In an era of supersonic jets and bullet trains, of flights to the moon and Googlemaps, Charles Lindbergh's legendary 33 
  hour and 30 minute solo flight across the Atlantic in the cramped cockpit of a one-engine plane continues to capture the 
  imagination of the world. "Lucky Lindy's" stripped down design and courage made him an idol to the world.  Lindbergh gave 
  the Spirit of St. Louis to the Smithsonian where it has been on display for over 80 years.
* Title | [Pilot Charles Lindbergh poses alongside his famous plane 'The Spirit of St. Louis']
  * Filename: MS0412-C-Lindbergh-Spirit_Autograph.xml
  * In 1919, French businessman Raymond Orteig established a $25000 prize to the first person to fly non-stop from New York 
  to Paris. Eight years later, Charles Augustus Lindbergh collected the prize. Lindbergh's achievement was a boon to the 
  fledgling aviation industry and while the Great Depression slowed some of that progress, Lindbergh's achievement set the 
  stage for airplane production in World War II.
* Title | Two Sites in Kidnap Case Linked to Suspect by Map
  * Filename: MS0412-C-Lindbergh-Sept_22_1934-02.xml
  * These two aerial photographs depict Bruno Hauptmann's upper Bronx home and St. Raymond's Cemetery, where the Lindbergh 
  ransom money was delivered.  Less than two miles separate the two locations. The New York Evening Journal was the first 
  newspaper to regularly team a reporter with a photographer on major stories. A complete in-house lab and photographic 
  technicians meant that that photojournalists could have images ready for print in 90 minutes.
* Title | Link Hauptmann to Kidnap Ladder: Traced to Lindy Home
  * Filename: MS0412-C-Lindbergh-Sept_22_1934-01.xml
  * The country followed the Lindbergh case as it was happening, as this issue of the New York Journal, published two days 
  before Bruno Hauptmann was indicted for extoring $50,000 from Charles Lindbergh, reveals.  A jotted-down license plate on a 
  gold certificate led police to Hauptmann's Bronx residence, where police found $14,000 in ransom money in a shoe box hidden 
  in the garage.  They also found wood in his attic that matched the wood of the ladder used to take the Lindbergh baby.
* Title | How Kidnappers (sic) Got Lindy Baby
  * Filename: MS0412-C-Lindbergh-Ladder-March_8_1932.xml
  * The public was fascinated by how Charles and Anne Lindbergh's baby was kidnapped. Newspapers were full of details like 
  this photograph of the home in Hopewell, New Jersey. The homemade ladder used to enter the baby's room proved critical in 
  determining the guilt of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a German-born carpenter, when the FBI called in a U.S. Department of 
  Agriculture wood expert to compare the ladder to identical wood in Hauptmann's attic.
