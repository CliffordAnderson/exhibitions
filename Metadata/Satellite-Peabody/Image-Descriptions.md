## Image Interactive Descriptions

_Below are descriptions for digital images requested for addition into the touchscreen interactives by the curator for the 
upcoming exhibition held in the Peabody Library. Text is not yet finalized and is subject to further editing._

* Image Title | Mei Li
  * Filename: PC-Mei_Li-Handforth-1938-01.jpg
  * Mei Li, honored as one of the first Caldecott winners, tells the story of a young Chinese girl out to prove to her brother 
  that anything he can do, she can do better.  Thomas Handforth's work at the time challenged not only traditional gender roles, 
  but introduced readers to a culture many were previously unfamiliar with.
* Image Title | Marisol McDonald Doesn't Match
  * Filename: PC-Marisol_McDonald_Doesn't_Match-Brown-2011.jpg
  * Marisol McDonald is no ordinary girl.  She has brown skin, red hair, and is a soccer-playing pirate- princess.  As a biracial 
  child with a diverse group of friend, Marisol is truly a modern day American kid.
