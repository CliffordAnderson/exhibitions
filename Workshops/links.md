###VRA Core

VRA Core is a data standard for the description of works of visual culture as well as the images that document them. The exhibitions program at Vanderbilt University Libraries specifically utilizes version 4.0, which was published in 2007. Under its specifications, two record components are necessary for a digitized asset: one describing the original work (work record), and one representing a digitized version and its properties (image record). This allows us to separate digital surrogates and edit/migrate them over time without altering any information about the original piece. 

The Library of Congress maintains the [VRA Core standard](http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/schemas.html) in association with the Visual Resources Association (VRA). [This document](http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/VRA_Core4_Intro.pdf) provides an easily digestible introduction to the standard. The [Element Outline](http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/VRA_Core4_Outline.pdf) is a quick resource for referencing the elements of VRA Core, and which sub-elements each can hold. Most are repeatable. The XML version of the VRA Core schema, which we'll be using during our workshops, can be found [here](http://www.loc.gov/standards/vracore/vra.xsd).
