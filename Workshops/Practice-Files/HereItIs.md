# [This is My Letter to the World](http://www.online-literature.com/dickinson/834/) 

### *Emily Dickinson's Mother* 

My daughter is my **gift** to the world,  
That *she never* wrote to me,--  
- Simply makes no difference,  
- With tender majesty.  
**Her message is committed**  
To hands I cannot see;   
*For love of her, sweet countrymen,*  
Judge tenderly of me! 

**I am not worthy of making changes to the text above**
