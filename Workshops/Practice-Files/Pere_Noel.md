# [This is My Letter to the World](http://www.online-literature.com/dickinson/834/) 

### *Emilia Dickinsonia* 

*This* is my Letter to the World,  
That *never, ever, **ever*** wrote to me, selfish thing--  
The simple News that Nature gossiped about,  
- With ever so tender majesty.  
Her massage is dreadfully **committed**  
To hands I cannot see;   
*For love of her, sweet countrymen,*  
Judge tenderly of me!
