# Encoding Practice

###Group Practice
![Tournee du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis](http://www.steinlen.net/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&g2_itemId=1839)

The above image is a digitial surrogate from _steinlen.net_ that looks very different from another [digital surrogate of the same work](http://www.sbma.net/collection/workonpaper.web) from the Santa Barbara Museum of Art (deaccessioned in 1991). This illustrates why it's so important to have separate metadata describing digitized images within catalog records for any given work or artifact. 

Now let's take a look at the [VRA Core 4.0 XML](http://core.vraweb.org/examples/html/example025_full_xml.html) for this poster. 
  * Thoughts? Anything unexpected you see or that you would have done differently? 
  * Take a look at both the work record and the image record within this XML document
  * [This](http://core.vraweb.org/examples/html/example025_full.html) is how users would see it.

###In Pairs

In teams of two, please break off and take a look at the links below. Try to encode these materials on your own. _No peeking at any raw XML!_
* [Medal of Emperor Rudolf II](http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=1449), J. Paul Getty Museum Online Collections

###Homework
On your own, encode this photograph of [Hodge Kirnon](http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/269445?rpp=30&pg=1&ft=alfred+stieglitz&pos=17) via the Metropolitan Museum of Art's (MET) Online Collection
* Use the existing record at the MET for information, and catalog it in VRA Core within oXygen
* Save your results under your Github account, titling your file "HodgeKirnon_yourusername" and comment on this page with the URL to your file by November 20th. 
  * Sara will take a look and provide feedback. Thanks!
