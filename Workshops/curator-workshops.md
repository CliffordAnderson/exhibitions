# Workshops for Exhibition Curators

* November 11-13, 2014

The 2014-2015 exhibition season is upon us! As the selected curators for this season, you will be the stewards of your given topics: responsible for researching, selecting, describing, and designing your portion of the overall exhibition in the coming year. This three-day workshop series will aim to familiarize you with a few tools that will help us track and manage digital description. This will help to streamline our process and allow us to have a single, updated point of reference for all metadata edits and changes in the coming year. 

These workshops will not presuppose any prior XML or markup knowledge.
