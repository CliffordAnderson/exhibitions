## Notes on DAM

* A DAM system MUST: 
  * provide metadata for images
  * export/import valid XML
  * allow embedded metadata within media types
  * support multiple media types
  * include different levels of permissions
  * be ADA compliant
* A DAM system WON'T: 
  * incorporate metadata into filenames
* A DAM system SHOULD:
  * incorporate a preservation layer (i.e. archivematica) 
  * automate/track edits and changes
