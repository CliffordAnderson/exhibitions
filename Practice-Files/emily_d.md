# [This is My Letter to the World](http://www.online-literature.com/dickinson/834/) 

### *Emily Dickinson* 

This is my **letter** to the world,  
That *never* wrote to me,--  
- The simple news that Nature told,  
- With tender majesty.  
**Her message is committed**  
To hands I cannot see;   
*For love of her, sweet countrymen,*  
Judge tenderly of me!
